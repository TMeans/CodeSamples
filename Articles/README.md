<h1>Articles System</h1>

<p>This project was made to retreive article information from a database and serve it to the client.</p>

<p>A portion of this project includes a "related" section that compares the current article with those in the database, ranking their similarity based on a number of criteria, and showing the most similar articles and other media to the user.</p>

<p>The code samples here show the structure and logic of the implementation using a mix of Javascript and C#. 

<p>**Database Context and other secure information has been omitted.**</p>
